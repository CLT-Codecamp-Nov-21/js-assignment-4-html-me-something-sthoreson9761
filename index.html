            <h2>What is "Javalin Warrior"?</h2>
            <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">Javalin Warrior is a web application designed for the purpose of teaching the basics of the Java programming language.  The idea behind this game came forth during the discussion for my groups final project.  After our discussion, we had come to an understanding that we all struggled a bit in our "Intro to Computer Programming 1" or ITSC-1212.  When we first started at the University of North Carolina - Charlotte, we had little to no previous programming experience.  The group decided to create this game in order for anyone new or interested in to computer programming to get a bit of experience with programming.  We had decided on the Java programming language because it is one of the most commonly used programming languages in the Computer Science field.  While Javalin Warrior is working and available to play, my group had a larger vision for what it should have been if we had more than a single semester to work on it.</p>

            <h2>The Larger Vision</h2>
            <p>The table bellow contains only a few of the features that we were unable to implement before the due date.</p>
            <table id="visTable">
               <thead>
                  <td class="feature">Feature</td>
                  <td class="description">Description</td>
               </thead>
               <tr class="visRow">
                  <td class="feature">User profiles</td>
                  <td class="description">Contains the information for an inarticleidual user. This information consists of the inarticleiduals
                  username and id, email, password, and levels they have completed and their input.</td>
               </tr>
               <tr class="visRow">
                  <td class="feature">Level selection</td>
                  <td class="description">Contains the list of levels that the user has completed and re-attempt them.</td>
               </tr>
               <tr class="visRow">
                  <td class="feature">User input flexibilty</td>
                  <td class="description">This is to allow the user to input a possibly correct answer instead of the exact line of code. Think of
                  this as using unit testing only the expected output can only be true if it meets certain requirements.</td>
               </tr>
               <tr class="visRow">
                  <td class="feature">Level difficulties</td>
                  <td class="description">This would allow the user to test their knowledge of programming. The lowest requires that the user input
                  only this area of code, while the highest requires the user to write all their (Java) code for the level
                  from scratch.</td>
               </tr>
            </table>
            <p class="lastPara">Just from the few items listed above, you can see how much of an undertaking this is.</p>

            <h2>Current Status</h2>
            <p>Javalin Warrior is stil a work in progress. Even though they have not been applied to the current version, there
            is one fully working feature and at least two are working in some aspects.</p>
            <h3>Fully working</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p><b>Contact developers from website</b>: allows for the user input their email and their question/concern
                  that they have and send it as an email to an assigned account.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Somewhat working</h3>
            <ul class="lastPara">
               <li>
                  <p><b>User profiles</b>: allows for the user to create and/or login to their profile as well as change their
                  password. When accessing their profile through a link in the menu bar while logged in is still causing
                  issues.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p><b>Level selection</b>: allows the user to view the content used in ALL the levels, but does show any level
                  specific items. and allow the user to input data, but fails to check if the user's answer is right or wrong
                  based on the level</p>
               </li>
